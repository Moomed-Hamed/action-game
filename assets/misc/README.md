# Journal
This repository was originally meant to be a safe space where i could
practice making games that didn't involve chunks(like my voxel game),
because being forced to design systems that need to support chunks
is hard, and the extra inertia whenever i tried to impement a new idea
was very frustrating.

"action game" was the original name for this repo, bceause my original vision for
this project was that it was going to be some kind of first person action game like DOOM.

This is what action-game's README looked like right before it became pirate-game

## action-game

i'm not sure what this repo will end up being.
for now, it's just a place where i have fun programming

### Animations
instead of traditional animation, a library of poses is used
with different interpolation techniques to add impact and fidelity.

### Particle System
simple but versitile particle system that is capable of basic effects
like fire, explosions, blood spurts, etc. it supports wind and physics as well.

### Multiplayer
nothing special here, just a basic multiplayer implementation 
that sends position & orientation data over tcp every few miliseconds.
