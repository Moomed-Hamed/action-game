### Animations
instead of traditional animation, a library of poses is used
with different interpolation techniques to add impact and fidelity.

### Particle System
simple but versitile particle system that is capable of basic effects
like fire, explosions, blood spurts, etc. it supports wind and physics as well.

that sends position & orientation data over tcp every few miliseconds.
